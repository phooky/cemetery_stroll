# Monument Grammar
# S is the start symbol
# lowercase strings are terminals
# Uppercase strings are symbols
# terminals can take parameters
# arms are seperated by pipes
# a float (<=1.0) at the start of an arm indicates the P of choosing that arm
# all arms without explicit P are assigned equal P out of remaining P
